Hi! I'm Chengyao Yu. I am currently a Master's student in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at the **Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)**, having joined the program in Fall 2025. 

I am fortunate to be advised by Professor **[Bingyi Jing](https://sai.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/162)**. My research interests lie broadly in both theoretical and applied statistics, and their applications in Artificial Intelligence. I look forward to actively engaging with the broader research community and collaborating on meaningful projects.


# Research interests

My research focuses on the intersection of statistical theory and machine learning applications in finance. I study the statistical foundations for reliable decision-making in high-stakes domains, around connected themes:

* **Reliable Artificial Intelligence**
  Designing procedures to evaluate when model predictions should be trusted, specifically for credit scoring systems. I am interested in applying **Conformal Prediction** to quantify uncertainty in financial risk models.

* **Multiple Hypotheses Testing**
  Studying how models perform when the population changes over time (e.g., PSI monitoring). Topics include handling **distribution shifts** in user behavior and ensuring model stability across different time periods.

* **Distribution Approximation Theory**
  My work covers statistical learning theory, high-dimensional statistics, and optimization. Much of my current work is motivated by real-world challenges in **Credit Risk Modeling**, aiming to provide rigorous statistical guarantees for business applications.

======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](https://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one Markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a Markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each Markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).




For more info
------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
