Hi! I'm Chengyao Yu.
I am currently a first-year Master’s student in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at the **Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)**.

I am fortunate to be advised by Professor **[Bingyi Jing](https://sai.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/162)**. My research interests lie broadly in both theoretical and applied statistics, and their applications in Artificial Intelligence. I look forward to actively engaging with the broader research community and collaborating on meaningful projects.


# Research interests

My research focuses on the intersection of statistical theory and machine learning applications in finance. I study the statistical foundations for reliable decision-making in high-stakes domains, around connected themes:

* **Reliable Artificial Intelligence**
  Designing procedures to evaluate when model predictions should be trusted, specifically for credit scoring systems. I am interested in applying **Conformal Prediction** to quantify uncertainty in financial risk models.

* **Multiple Hypotheses Testing**
  Studying how models perform when the population changes over time (e.g., PSI monitoring). Topics include handling **distribution shifts** in user behavior and ensuring model stability across different time periods.

* **Distribution Approximation Theory**
  My work covers statistical learning theory, high-dimensional statistics, and optimization. Much of my current work is motivated by real-world challenges in **Credit Risk Modeling**, aiming to provide rigorous statistical guarantees for business applications.


# News

* **2025.10**: My paper "Random Weighting Approximation of M-estimators with Increasing Dimensions of Parameter" has been accepted by **Statistica Sinica**. (Advised by Prof. [Zhanfeng Wang](https://bs.ustc.edu.cn/english/profile-106.html) and Prof. [Ruixing Ming](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ruixing-Ming))
